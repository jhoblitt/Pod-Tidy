=head1 NAME

Pod::Wrap::Pretty - reformat Pod to be nicely line wrapped

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Pod::Wrap::Pretty;

    my $w = new Pod::Wrap::Pretty;

    $w->parse_from_filehandle($fh);
    $w->parse_from_file($filename);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is a L<Pod::Wrap> subclass, which is in turn a L<Pod::Parser> subclass.
Please see the Pods of those modules for further API documentation.

This module performs the exact same functionality as L<Pod::Wrap> I<except>
that all pre-existing newlines are removed prior to line breaking and trailing
whitespace is removed from the end of paragraphs.  This provides nicely
formatted paragraphs similar to L<vim>'s C<gq> command.

=head1 DEVELOPER NOTES

These C<Pod::Wrap> subroutines have been overridden.

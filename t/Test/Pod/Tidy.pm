perlpodspec - Plain Old Documentation: format specification and notes

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This document is detailed notes on the Pod markup language.  Most
people will only have to read L<perlpod|perlpod> to know how to write
in Pod, but this document may answer some incidental questions to do
with parsing and rendering Pod.

In this document, "must" / "must not", "should" /
"should not", and "may" have their conventional (cf. RFC 2119)
meanings: "X must do Y" means that if X doesn't do Y, it's against
this specification, and should really be fixed.  "X should do Y"
means that it's recommended, but X may fail to do Y, if there's a
good reason.  "X may do Y" is merely a note that X can do Y at
will (although it is up to the reader to detect any connotation of
"and I think it would be I<nice> if X did Y" versus "it wouldn't
really I<bother> me if X did Y").

Notably, when I say "the parser should do Y", the
parser may fail to do Y, if the calling application explicitly
requests that the parser I<not> do Y.  I often phrase this as
"the parser should, by default, do Y."  This doesn't I<require>
the parser to provide an option for turning off whatever
feature Y is (like expanding tabs in verbatim paragraphs), although
it implicates that such an option I<may> be provided.
